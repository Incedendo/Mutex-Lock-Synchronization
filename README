PROJECT 3: MUTEX LOCKS AND CONDITIONAL MUTEX

There are 2 supporting files:
	queue.c (and queue.h)
	LinkList.c (and LinkList.h)

The makefile is capable of:
	compiling the main oscp3 executable from oscp3.c and corresponding extenal files.
	compiling the main testQueue executable that tests the operations of queue
	compiling the main testList executable that tests the operations of linked list

Progress:
	I wrote my own Linklist.c and Queue.c support .c files initially and later rewrote them to comply with the object-oriented design paradigm.

	I wrote 2 test programs testQueue.c and testList.c to test out all the individual functions of List and Queue classes.

	The main oscp3.c was written based on the pseudo-code given by Professor Mike Scherger.

	3 mutexes were used to lock the queue, the list and the condition variables to ensure mutual exclusions.
